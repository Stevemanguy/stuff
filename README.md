# Project Three
In this project, I developed a straightforward item-tracking application for the Corner Grocer, aimed at optimizing their produce layout based on purchase frequencies. Key strengths of my approach include a seamless handling of input case variations and the efficient use of a map for data storage, which could be further improved by integrating input validation and expanding its data sources for real-time updates. The challenge of case-insensitive search was tackled through meticulous string manipulation, enhancing my skill set in C++ string handling and data normalization. This experience not only strengthened my capabilities in file I/O and data structures but also in crafting user-centric, maintainable software. By sticking to principles of clean code and encapsulation, the program is fitted for ease of updates and readability, making it a strong template for future projects requiring data analysis and user interaction.
